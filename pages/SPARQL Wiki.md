- Welcome!
- This is a knowledge graph about [[SPARQL]]. It contains a summary page of a [[SPARQL training course]], links to [tutorials]([[Tutorial]]) and video lectures, specifications, [endpoints]([[SPARQL Endpoints]]), explanations of SPARQL keywords and functions, syntax, [query examples]([[Query]]) and many other resources. The graph will grow based on the knowledge captured from training sessions, support chats, and [feedback](mailto:ivo@velitchkov.eu?subject=%5BSPARQL%20wiki%5D%20Question%2Ffeedback).
- This knowledge graph has special features for content use and exploration not available in traditional wikis. You can use it intuitively, or you may check these [tips]([[How to use this graph?]]) first.
