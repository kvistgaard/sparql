- Turtle is a syntax and file format for expressing data in the [[RDF]] data model. "Turtle" stands for "Terse RDF Triple Language". It is created with the intention to represent RDF in a compact and natural text form.
- Turtle is a W3C standard (See RDF 1.1 Turtle Specification)
- All RDF written in Turtle is usable in [[SPARQL]][*](((61ef8d42-f778-4f31-95f3-1b76bd13f743))). This allows forming "queries by example", using the data to make an initial query.
